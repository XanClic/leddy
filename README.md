leddy
=====

Linux LED controller for the fnatic miniSTREAK.

(Works on Windows, too, though: https://xanclic.moe/leddy.exe)

Installation
------------

1. install rust: `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh`
2. download repository: `git clone https://github.com/XanClic/leddy.git`
3. install needed packages: `sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev pkg-config`
5. install leddy: `cargo install --path=.`

Usage
-----

See `leddy --help` for a description of the supported effects.

You may need to run leddy with root rights to change your keyboard’s lighting.

Examples
--------

Some examples for effects:
* `leddy color=rgb:ff4000`: Colors the whole keyboard orange
* `leddy reactive-ripple/keyup`: Creates a ripple (in changing colors,
  following the rainbow pattern) whenever a key is released
* `leddy wave/color=rainbow`: Lets a rainbow roll over the keyboard
* `leddy rain/direction=down/speed=20/color=rgb:40ff00`: Lets bright green rain
  drops flow slowly over your keyboard
* `leddy gradient/color=gradient:ff0000@0,00ff00@70,0000ff@100`: Creates kind of
  a rainbow gradient from left to right, where green is right of center
* `leddy fade/color=gradient:ff8080,3080ff,ff8080`: Fades between pink
  and blue (note that the positions are distributed evenly when omitted; also
  note that the color for positions 0 and 100 is the same)
* `leddy --profile=2`: Switch to profile 2 (note that without the `--profile`
  switch (or `-p` for short), leddy will always switch to and modify profile 1).
* `leddy screen-capture`: Lets ffmpeg take 18×6 pixel screenshots and displays
  them on the keyboard (in 60 FPS).

### sound-spectrum

`sound-spectrum` is a software effect (that is, like `screen-capture`, leddy
keeps running and manually updates all keys’ colors) that expects raw PCM data
from stdin (44100 Hz s16 little-endian mono samples).  For example, it can be
used as follows:
```
parecord -r \
    -d $(LANG=C pactl info | grep Sink | sed -e 's/[^:]*..//').monitor \
    --raw --rate=44100 --channels=1 --format=s16le --latency-msec=50 \
    | leddy sound-spectrum
```

On Windows with ffmpeg, first get the device name:
```
ffmpeg -list_devices true -f dshow -i dummy
```
And then:
```
ffmpeg -f dshow -audio_buffer_size 10 -i audio="[input source]" \
    -f s16le -ac 1 -bufsize 1k - \
    | leddy sound-spectrum
```

Note that Powershell buffers pipe data until the first process has exited, so
you will have to invoke the above in cmd.

udev rule
---------

You may put your desired effect into a configuration file like
`/etc/leddy.conf`, e.g.:

```
gradient/color=gradient:3080ff@0,3080ff@20,ff8080@20,ff8080@40,d0fff0@40,d0fff0@60,ff8080@60,ff8080@80,3080ff@80,3080ff@100
```

Then you can let `xargs` pass its content to leddy in a udev rule, like so:

```
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2f0e", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0102" RUN+="/bin/sh -c '/usr/bin/xargs /usr/bin/leddy < /etc/leddy.conf'"
```

Store this as a file in `/etc/udev/rules.d`, and your customization should be
applied on system startup or whenever the keyboard is plugged in.

Considering that the keyboard does have memory to store every profile’s setting,
this generally shouldn’t be necessary, though (apart from maybe switching the
active profile).  However, you may find it useful to add `MODE="666"` to be able
to run leddy without root rights.  I don’t know what the security implications
of that are, though (i.e., whether this would allow any program to log keyboard
input).
